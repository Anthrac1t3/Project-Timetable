# Project Timetable

A Simple Event and Todo Management Tool, that helps you stay on your personal schedule.

## Description

Events can be entered in on any time table that the user wishes, and a static To-Do list is available for general time-insensitive projects. The app would remind the user a set time before the event, or should the user wish to prioritize the event, the app would progressively more aggressively send reminders to the user until the user marks the event as complete. The app would be lightweight, but have pop ups and audio notifications.
